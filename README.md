# ANALYSIS OF BANK CUSTOMER CHURN USING EXCEL

## Business   Problem

Customer churn analysis addresses the need to understand and mitigate customer attrition. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services, 
is a significant concern for businesses across various industries. High churn rates can lead to decreased revenue, reduced market share, and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers to replace those lost.

Identifying the factors contributing to customer churn and predicting which customers are at risk of leaving allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers. 
By addressing underlying issues, improving customer experience, and implementing targeted retention strategies, businesses can reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty and profitability.

Therefore, the primary business problem addressed by customer churn analysis is how to minimize customer attrition and maximize customer retention to sustain and grow the business.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Ensuring data is clean and organized. Removing any duplicate entries, filling in missing values, and formating  data appropriately.

## Data Analysis: 
This includes performing Exploratory Data Analysis to check feature correlations and data distributions, then moving on with Modelling.

## Dashboard Visualization: 

We will create visualizations such as charts and graphs to present our findings effectively. 

### Churn Drivers Analysis:
Analyzing factors contributing to churn, such as customer satisfaction scores, service usage metrics, or customer support interactions. Use charts and tables to visualize correlations between these factors and churn rates.

## Machine Learning Modelling
This was a binary classification Project and hence utilises the binary classification models . Having Logistic Regression as the baseline model then Decision Trees and Exploring the ensemble models such as Random Forest Classifiers, Gradient Boosting Models that are enhancements of decision trees.

### Performance Metrics
To check on how accurate our best model is we utilised Metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. With recall being the main focus since it focuses on how often a machine learning model correctly identifies positive instances (true positives) from all the actual positive samples in the dataset.
